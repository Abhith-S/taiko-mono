<FAQBox title="What is Taiko?">
Taiko is a fully permissionless and decentralized Ethereum-equivalent ZK-Rollup. This means using Taiko is exactly the same as using Ethereum. Not only does Taiko support all EVM opcodes, but it supports the full JSON-RPC execution client API.
Taiko is an L2 that derives it's security from Ethereum. There is no centralized sequencer or provers, all operations are permissionless and community driven. Read more about Taiko under our [concepts section](/docs/concepts/overview).

<FAQBox title="What is a Type 1 ZK-EVM?">
The different types of ZK-EVMs make tradeoffs between compatibility and proof generation cost. A Type 1 ZK-EVM prioritizes compatibility over proof generation cost.

Another term for Type 1 ZK-EVMs is “Ethereum-equivalent”. This term comes from the fact that Type 1 ZK-EVMs make no changes to the Ethereum architecture, whether it be the hash function, state trees, or gas costs. This equivalency allows us to reuse execution clients with minimal modification.

<FAQBox title="Is Taiko open source?">
Yes, Taiko is open source under the permissive MIT license (free to access and modify). The Geth fork ([taiko-geth](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-geth)) retains the original Geth GPL licenses.
